HTML Entities:-

HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters
in HTML markup. These characters, if used directly in HTML, might be 
interpreted as code rather than as text. Entities start with an 
ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`).



Here are five commonly used HTML entities:-

1. `&lt;` - Less Than Sign (<):
   - Represents the less than symbol `<`. It is used to display the less than sign without starting an HTML tag.

2. `&gt;` - Greater Than Sign (>):
   - Represents the greater than symbol `>`. It is used to display the greater than sign without ending an HTML tag.

3. `&amp;` - Ampersand (&):
   - Represents the ampersand `&`. It is used to display the ampersand character without starting an HTML entity.

4. `&quot;` - Double Quotation Mark ("):
   - Represents the double quotation mark `"`. It is used to display double quotes within an attribute value that is 
   already enclosed in double quotes.

5. `&copy;` - Copyright Symbol (Â©):
   - Represents the copyright symbol. It is often used to indicate copyright ownership.

These entities help ensure proper rendering of characters in HTML documents and are particularly useful when you want
to display characters that have special meanings in HTML or that might conflict with the code structure.
