Html5 features :-

HTML5, the fifth revision of the Hypertext Markup Language, 
introduced several new features and improvements over its 
predecessors. 
Here's a list of some key features of HTML5:

1.Semantic Elements:

<header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>,
<figure>, <figcaption>, <details>, <summary>, etc. 
These elements provide a more meaningful structure to web documents.


2.Multimedia Support:

<audio> and <video> elements for embedding media content without
third-party plugins.


3.Canvas:

The <canvas> element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of
2D shapes and bitmap images.


4.SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):

HTML5 includes native support for vector graphics through the SVG format.


5.Form Controls:

New input types like <email>, <url>, <tel>, <number>, <range>, <date>,
<time>, and <color> provide better user input options.


6.Form Validation:

The pattern attribute and the required attribute help with client-side form validation.


7.Local Storage:

The localStorage and sessionStorage objects allow web applications to store
data locally on the user's device.


8.Web Workers:

The ability to run scripts in the background using Web Workers, improving 
performance by offloading tasks from the main thread.


9.Geolocation API:

The Geolocation API allows web applications to access the user's geographical location.


10.Web Storage:

Provides a way to store key/value pairs in a web browser with no expiration time.


11.WebSockets:

Supports full-duplex communication channels over a single, long-lived connection.


12.Server-Sent Events (EventSource):

Enables servers to push data to web clients over HTTP in real-time.


13.Offline Web Applications:

The Application Cache allows web applications to work offline.


14.Responsive Design:

HTML5 facilitates the development of responsive websites with features like media queries.


15.Drag and Drop:

Native drag-and-drop functionality simplifies the implementation of intuitive user interfaces.


16.New Document Outlining:

The <article>, <section>, and <nav> elements provide a clearer document structure.

17.Improved Accessibility:

New attributes and features enhance accessibility, making it easier for users with
disabilities to navigate and understand content.


18.Integration of MathML and WAI-ARIA:

Support for MathML (Mathematical Markup Language) for rendering mathematical equations
and WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) for 
improved accessibility.
These features collectively contribute to making web development more versatile, efficient, 
and user-friendly. Keep in mind that browser support may vary, and developers need to 
consider fallbacks for older browsers.
