Q4.List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.
ans:-
Improving the accessibility of HTML involves implementing practices that 
make content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for a diverse 
range of users. 

Here are three key ways to enhance the accessibility of HTML:

1. Use Semantic HTML:
   - Employing semantic HTML elements helps convey the structure and meaning 
    of content to both users and assistive technologies. 
    Choose appropriate HTML tags for different types of content, such as headings
    (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and 
    semantic elements like `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<figure>`. 
    Semantic HTML provides context and improves the experience for users relying 
    on screen readers or other assistive technologies.

2. Provide Descriptive Text Alternatives:
   - Use descriptive text alternatives for non-text content, such as images,
    using the `alt` attribute. This ensures that users with visual impairments 
    or those using text-only browsers receive meaningful information. 
    Write concise and accurate descriptions that convey the purpose or content of the image. 
    
    For example:
     
     <img src="example.jpg" alt="A person reading a book in a library">
     

3. Create Accessible Forms:
   - Ensure that forms are accessible by providing clear labels for form controls. 
   Use the `<label>` element to associate text labels with form elements, improving 
   navigation for users with screen readers. Additionally, use appropriate input types, 
   such as `<input type="text">`, `<input type="email">`, and `<input type="checkbox">`, 
   to enhance the user experience for different input scenarios. 
   Include helpful instructions and error messages for form validation. 
   
   Example:
    
     <label for="username">Username:</label>
     <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
     

These practices contribute to a more accessible web experience, ensuring that content is 
well-structured, perceivable, and understandable for users with diverse needs and abilities. 
Remember to test your website using accessibility tools and consider involving users with 
disabilities in the testing process to gather valuable feedback.
